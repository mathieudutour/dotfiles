#!/usr/bin/env zsh
#
# A wrapper around Mac's sandbox-exec that lets you easily run terminals/programs within sandboxes for a slightly safer day-to-day computing experience.
#
# Useful if you don't want every npm/cargo/pip transitive dependency to have full access to your filesystem and network.
#
# See [this writeup](https://kevinlynagh.com/newsletter/2020_04_how_fast_can_plants_grow/) for a bit more background.
#
# USAGE:
#
# - `$ sb` opens a shell in an offline sandbox that can only read/write the current directory and its children. See base.sb for the default sandbox profile.
#
# - `$ sb online` opens a shell in an online sandbox.
#
# - `$ sb online -- ping www.google.com` runs ping www.google.com in an online sandbox and returns.
#
# - `$ sb foo bar baz -- command` sources profiles foo.sb, bar.sb, baz.sb from the profile directory and runs command within that sandbox.
#
# If an app doesn't work a sanbox, search for "sandbox" in Console.app to see what permissions the app was denied and try granting these permissions via a custom profile.
#
